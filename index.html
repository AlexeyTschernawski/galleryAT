    <h1>Michail Tschernjavski</h1>
    <p>...that is the right thing to create "music for the eyes", 
        but in reality to learn what sounds in nature, music, color, 
        light, transfiguration and so on. An artist who does not study nature, 
        nobody can imagine the language he wants to talk about, nobody can hear the 
        color music and is not an artist, like that The musician doesn't stand still...Â» Falk R. P.</p>
